This Hotel Management System is designed to handle key operations such as managing customer details, booking rooms across four different types, placing food orders for specific rooms, unbooking rooms, and generating bills. It also allows users to view room features and check room availability. The application is menu-driven and continues running until the user decides to exit. To ensure that hotel data (like customer details, room bookings, and food orders) is preserved across sessions, file handling is used to save the current state when the program exits. On restarting, the program reads from this file to restore the previous state. File writing is executed in a separate thread to allow it to run concurrently. A user-defined exception is used to handle attempts to book already occupied rooms, and comprehensive exception handling is implemented to manage unexpected errors gracefully.
